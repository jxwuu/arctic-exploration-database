# 304DatabaseProject
Project description:
The domain that we are going to model is Arctic exploration. That is, we’re going to focus on the storage of data gathered by researchers exploring the Arctic.

We will focus on researchers exploring the Arctic ecosystem. This includes things like the expedition team’s physical attributes (height, age), the ship they rode to get to the Arctic, exploration vehicles required, animals and plants researched, and geographical discoveries. Each geographical location will have an accompanying recorded daily weather. Cargo transported by ship will be separated into food items and scientific equipment. 

Database specifications:
There will be two different classes of users of the system: researchers and crew members.
Researchers will be able to update the database with their findings, such as new species discovered and the characteristics of these species. They will also be able to record their day-to-day events such as weather and temperature, number and type of animals encountered, as well as the plants that they will encounter. While the crew members will be the only ones able to take out exploration vehicles for their expedition. The cargo that they bring will also be recorded. 

Description of the application platform:
Our project platform will use PHP and we will use mySQL as the database. Our front end will be written in HTML, and CSS.
